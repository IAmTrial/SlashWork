# SlashDiablo Tools Project

## History

Around 2011, the very first iteration of the BH maphack was written by McGod of the BlizzHackers forum, hence why it is often called BH. The source code and injector were made available to the public, with the injector licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3.

In 2011, Deadlock39 modified the BH hack (original post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180403231144/https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/m1o5a/update_v012_for_bh_branch/)), customizing it for the SlashDiablo community. One year later, Underbent obtained a copy of the source code, made his changes for v1.1.3, and released those changes to the public (original post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180403231445/https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/1286jz/bh_maphack_v013/)). The source code has been made available [here](https://github.com/underbent/slashdiablo-maphack).

Over the years, additional contributors, including slippittydo, decker87, slayergod13, lolisquad, planqi, and Mir Drualga, added their own custom changes on top of the original hack, incorporating new features and fixing bug present in previous versions. This continued community development has allowed the maphack to become what it is today.

## License

SlashDiablo Tools is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or greater. But it was not always that way.

As noted, the injector for BH has been licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or greater. Unfortunately, McGod has only added these notices to the injector and not the maphack itself. This ambiguity allows anyone to take the source code of the maphack, make modifications to improve it, and distribute the binaries while never publishing the source. This goes agaisnt the spirit of what this project has been founded upon.

To discourage this behavior, SlashDiablo Tools has been licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or greater. This effectively prevents anyone from directly using the souce code and redistributing binaries without providing the source code. Not only that, but if any of the source code or binaries are used for game servers, then that source must also be made available, as required by the *Affero* version of the GPL. If a violation of the license has been spotted, please contact the SlashDiablo or Diablo2Resurgence team on the appropriate Discord channels.

# SlashDiablo Maphack Project

## History

Around 2011, the very first iteration of the maphack was written by McGod of the BlizzHackers forum, released under the name BH. The source code and injector were made available to the public, with the injector licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3.

In 2011, Deadlock39 modified the BH hack (original post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180403231144/https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/m1o5a/update_v012_for_bh_branch/)), customizing it for the SlashDiablo community. One year later, Underbent obtained a copy of the source code, made his changes for v1.1.3, and released those changes to the public (original post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180403231445/https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/1286jz/bh_maphack_v013/)). The source code has been made available [here](https://github.com/underbent/slashdiablo-maphack).

Over the years, additional contributors, including slippittydo, decker87, slayergod13, lolisquad, planqi, and Mir Drualga, added their own custom changes that incorporate new features and fixes bugs present in previous versions. This continued community development has allowed the maphack to become what it is today.

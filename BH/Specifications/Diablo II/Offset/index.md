# Diablo II Offset

Game offsets are utilized in order to define where the individual variables and functions of Diablo II are located.

## History

See [here](../Version).

## The Problem

The input of offsets does not account for different versions of Diablo II. Porting BH from one version to another requires replacing every single offset.

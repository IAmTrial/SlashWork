# SlashGaming Modding API

The documentation for a modding API that accounts for game version, structs, constants, patches, data, and functions. The goal of this documentation is to provide a rationale for the choices made in design.

- [Configuration](Config/): Provide a standard user configuration
- [Data](Data/): Expose getters and settters of game data (otherwise known as variables)
- [Function](Function/): Expose game functions to callers and standardize the calling convention
- [Patch](Patch/): Override game code with custom code
- [Struct](Struct/): Provide data structures as designed for the game
- [Version](Version/): Detect game versions
